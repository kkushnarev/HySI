Annotation: McCloskey (Biometrika, 2024) proposes a hybrid confidence interval (HySi) method to adjust coverage after a model selection event. This method combines the PoSI framework with a frequentist approach and constructs valid confidence intervals regardless of the model selection outcome, drawn from a set of alternatives. I implement the HySi framework in Stata (the hysi package) for LASSO regression using a fixed, user-chosen lambda. An upcoming update will extend the package to support data-driven lambda selection. To facilitate comparison with other post-selection inference methods, the hysi package also includes alternative approaches such as PoSI and selective inference (Lee et al., 2016). Detailed functionality is available in the package help file. To familiarise the user with post-selected inference, this document guides on the theory and the applications to the LASSO framework.
